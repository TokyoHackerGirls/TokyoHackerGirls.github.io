&lt;p>Or maybe, I’m actually learning to love myself.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If I had to name the single biggest change in my life, it would be this: I’ve started embracing myself, completely and without reserve. And in doing so, I’ve learned so much. Day by day, I’m confronting my thoughts, both light and dark, with honesty, trying to understand the sources that shape them. I feel like I’m living more insightfully than ever before.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So today, let’s talk about something I’ve been learning for years: how to start loving your body from where you are now.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As someone who didn’t always care for themselves, I’m actually proud of how far I’ve come.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There’s no such thing as a “perfect body” in this world—most people are constantly chasing some ideal of thinner or stronger, fairer or more bronzed, even going so far as to alter their perfectly healthy faces and bodies.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Ironically, those who obsess over narrow beauty standards are rarely content with themselves. There’s always a new trend to chase, and society’s ideals are often warped—every model in Asia, it seems, is almost skeletal. The weight-loss, food, and fashion industries conspire to fuel anxiety and drain our wallets. Our society frankly don&amp;rsquo;t want us feel beautiful in our own skin. How do they make money otherwise?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The solution, then, is simple: love your body now, starting today.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This is the only solution. Sure, maybe your photo won’t end up on the cover of a beauty magazine, and you may not turn heads on the street. But does that even matter? A mouth that can eat is a good mouth, and legs that can walk are good legs. You are unique, with both flaws and strengths. If you love beauty, focus on your strengths. If not, just be yourself.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Personally, I love people with a bit of softness. There’s a warmth in hugging someone with a little more to them. I love soft faces—they feel so nice to squeeze. And honestly, who doesn’t think a bit of a belly is adorable? People may be self-conscious about it, but to me, a little belly feels like lying on a cloud. If I had a partner lying beside me who was okay with it, I’d probably just want to hold and play with it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Secretly, I hope no one with a soft belly ever tries to lose it. Little tummies are one of the sweetest things in the world.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And I adore slim people too. They often have a style that makes any outfit look amazing. Slim legs make any pants or socks look effortlessly cool. Honestly, if there were magic for slim legs, I’d probably spend a fortune on it (…though some people like my thick thighs with knee-high socks). As much as I rave about large chests, if I had a flat chest, I think I’d love that too. No worries about clothes revealing too much, or people thinking exposed skin is somehow inviting them in. Slim guys give me the impression they’re athletic and smart, while slim girls just look effortlessly chic. I just think having a thin partner would be so charming, like dating a character straight out of an anime.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Don’t let body image give you anxiety—let it give you pride. In a world this big, someone will love every part of you simply because it’s you. And if the odds are 0.001%? Well, that’s still over 80,000 people on this earth who’d love you just as you are.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>That’s the entire population of Cambridge, England.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It’s just up to you to find them.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Winter is here, and it’s the perfect time to clear out your closet. Donate the clothes that don’t fit anymore—you probably won’t wear them again. Take a photo to remember them by, then let them go to someone who’ll love them. And when your body changes, buy new clothes then. Let your old clothes have a new life on someone else.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>When you shop, remember your actual measurements. Don’t buy the wrong size or something uncomfortable or allergenic. The right size exists; sometimes it just takes looking overseas or online to find it. This world has millions of people with body shapes like yours—there are clothes out there that will fit.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Anyone can be beautiful. Every single person. All it takes is to find someone similar to you, someone you admire, whether it’s their fashion, art, or music. Use them as your reference, learn from them, and anyone can shine like an influencer. But the world doesn’t require you to be an influencer; you’re already beautiful just as you are.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Finally, think of the parts of your body that bring you joy. Your straight or curly hair, your thick or delicate eyebrows, your broad or narrow shoulders, your firm or soft thighs. You should love yourself the way a mother cherishes her newborn. In someone’s eyes, you are the most perfect person in the world.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The world and all the little doubts in your mind will always be there. But as long as I keep loving myself, I know I’ll live a good, good life.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
